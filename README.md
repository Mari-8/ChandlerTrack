# Chandler-Track 

Chandler-Track is an application for anyone in the candle making world. It allows you to keep track of your candle recipes, your current inventory, and notes. 

I have a lot of improvements in mind, and things i just didnt quite have time to fit in. That being said this is already a very useful tool to keep track of candle making. 

## Installation 

       Fork and clone
       type ``` bundle install ``` 
       type ``` cd chandler_track_backend ``` 
       type ``` rails s ``` 
       Open a second terminal 
       type ``` cd frontend ``` 
       type ``` open index.html ``` 

And your ready to rock!
